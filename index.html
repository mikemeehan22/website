        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am currently teaching 8th grade social studies in Wake County. 
            This is my 8th year teaching. 
            With the shift due to the pandemic in 2020, I have developed a passion for ed tech. 
            I made the decision to start the Learning Design & Technology masters degree last semester.
            </p>
