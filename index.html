                        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1164159964845182976/1nd2SyG7_400x400.jpg" class="right" alt= "Michael Meehan & the West Lake Wildcat" style= "width: 300px; height: auto;" align="right" />
                        <p><h3><b>My Beginnings</b></h3></p>
                        <p>My teaching experience started immediately after I graduated from college in the fall of 2013. 
                            After substitute teaching for the spring of 2014, I was accepted to Teach For America (TFA), a nonprofit organization that places corps members specifically in low-income and high-need areas and schools. 
                            Through this opportunity, I was privileged to get to work with a diverse range of students and their families. 
                            Those three years are what have shaped and refined my teaching philosophy into what it is today. Since 2017 I have been teaching 8th grade social studies in Apex, North Carolina.</p>
                        <p><h3><b>My Teaching Philosophy</b></h3></p>
                        <p> As a teacher, I use a variety of teaching strategies, techniques, and methodologies in the classroom. 
                            I believe it is crucial to engage students in meaningful activities that require them to think critically, allow them to make personal connections, and offer them chances to communicate in a way that deepens their understanding of the content. 
                            I view myself as a facilitator of learning rather than a dispenser of knowledge, a “guide on the side” as opposed to a “sage on the stage.” 
                            A passion of mine is designing engaging curriculum to promote critical thinking, collaboartion, communication and creativity. 
                            I have had opportunities to write curriculum in both school districts I have taught in.
                        <a type="button" id="readmore">Read More > </a>
                        <div class="hidden">
                          <a type="button" id="readless">Read Less < </a>
                        <p>In addition to designing innovative curriculum that is challenging and student-driven, I value and prioritize building trusting relationships with my students. 
                            The past eight years of teaching have taught me that students are more likely to excel when they are in a safe learning environment where failure is recognized and expected as a natural part of the learning process. I am committed to spending time with my students to understand how they learn and who they are as individuals, because I agree with the saying that says, “Students don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.”
                            In summary, my passion for creating engaging curriculum and my strong relationships with my students are the key factors that drive my educational philosophy and motivate me as a teacher. 
                            These two things enable me to get my students invested in and excited about their learning, so that they are better equipped to continue their journeys in education and in life.</p>
